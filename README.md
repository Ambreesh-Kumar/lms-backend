## 💳 Payment Module (Razorpay Integration – EJS + API)

#### 🔐 Secure & Flexible Payment Architecture
This LMS supports **two payment flows**:
1. **Server-Rendered Checkout (EJS)** – used for demo & backend-only validation
2. **API-Based Checkout** – preserved for future frontend integration (React / Mobile)

Both flows share the **same verification logic and database guarantees**.

#### 🧭 Payment Checkout Flow (EJS – Server Rendered)
1. Student login (`https://lms-backend-rmh5.onrender.com/api/auth/login`) in Postman and get **accessToken** 
2. Student enrolls in a paid course `https://lms-backend-rmh5.onrender.com/api/enrollments`
3. Server creates / reuses a Razorpay order
4. Student open Checkout page in browser `GET /payments/ejs/checkout/:enrollmentId?token=<accessToken>`
   * checkout_url example:
   ```
   https://lms-backend-rmh5.onrender.com/payments/ejs/checkout/695bf4a91c49853b851d6665/?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2OTRiZjZiZThmODY5NWY3NTk2YTMxY2MiLCJyb2xlIjoic3R1ZGVudCIsImlhdCI6MTc2NzYzNTgwNSwiZXhwIjoxNzY3NjM2NzA1fQ.sxOW79venrTFhYlSM9AWupt0nNjexPQg75wEUg13Qy8
   ```
5. Razorpay Checkout modal opens
6. Razorpay redirects payment details to backend
7. Backend verifies:
  * Signature (HMAC SHA256)
  * Order ↔ Payment integrity
  * Idempotency (prevents double payment)
8. Enrollment activated using MongoDB transaction
9. User is redirected to result page:
  * ✅ success
  * ❌ failure
  * ⚠️ cancelled
  * ℹ️ already paid
⚠️ All critical state changes happen **only on the server**

#### 🖥️ EJS Checkout Routes
| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | /payments/ejs/checkout/:enrollmentId | Render Razorpay checkout page (EJS) |
| POST   | /payments/ejs/verify                 | Verify payment & update DB          |

Authentication for EJS checkout is handled via **access token in query params** (for backend-only demo use).

#### 🔁 Payment APIs (Preserved for Frontend Use)
| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                       | Access  |

| POST   | /api/payments/create-order | Create Razorpay order via API     | Student |
| POST   | /api/payments/verify       | Verify Razorpay payment signature | Student |

#### 🛡️ Payment Safety & Consistency
* ✔ Razorpay signature verification (HMAC SHA256)
* ✔ Idempotent verification (safe retry support)
* ✔ MongoDB transactions (Payment + Enrollment)
* ✔ Prevents:
   * Double payments
   * Order reuse abuse
   * Partial DB updates
* ✔ Clear handling for:
   * Already paid enrollment
   * Expired / invalid session
   * Cancelled payments

#### 🧪 Razorpay Test Card Details
##### ✅ Successful Payment
| Card Number         | Expiry     | CVV |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --- |
| 5267 3181 8797 5449 | Any future | 123 |
##### ❌ Failed Payment
* Use any invalid OTP or cancel payment in Razorpay modal

International cards are not supported in Razorpay test mode (India).
